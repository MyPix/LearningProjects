Pixel-Storm

This is a basic interpreter with a basic syntax analysis, feel free to use for knowledge

Basic char-char reading of a line
Instructions can be found in the main.cpp and in tk.storm


Basic interpreter
----
print:Testing my fucking basic interpreter &nGO ! Enter something ! &n-->;
sleepms:555;
getline+sprint;
write% %input% @ mike.txt;
write% Dude, it's magic ! @ mark.txt;


- print: -> Printing something in console, use &n to make a new line (\n)
- sleepms:(time ms); -> Sleeping for a time in milliseconds
- getline+sprint; -> Get user input (cin) and prints it in console
- write% (message) @ (file.extension); -> Write something in a file 
- write% %input% @ (file.extension); -> Will do the same thing as Getline but will write the result in a file

Can be buggy, Fork if you find and correct bugs
